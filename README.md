# ðŸš— USA Accidents Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a large-scale dataset of road accidents in the United States. The goal was to explore patterns, trends, and potential factors contributing to accidents across different regions and time periods in the country.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- Performed **data cleaning** to handle missing values.
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using visualizations and statistical summaries.
- Extracted meaningful **inferences** based on location, time, temperature, and other relevant features.
- Applied a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict accident severity levels based on selected features.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Dataset used- https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents
- The dataset includes millions of accident records collected from various sources across the USA.

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model

A **Random Forest Classifier** was implemented to predict the **Severity** of accidents (ranging from 1 to 4). Key steps include:

- Selected relevant features such as weather conditions, location coordinates, visibility, and time-based attributes.
- Encoded categorical variables and handled missing data.
- Trained the model on 750,000+ records.
- Achieved an accuracy of over **85%** on the test set.
- Visualized **confusion matrix** for model interpretation.

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the notebook `accidents_analysis.ipynb` to explore the analysis
